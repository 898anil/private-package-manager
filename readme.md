Why :
	As a hobby project for personal use - getting the modules or small files i have written in another folder or project easily and have the option to update them with new code.


Sharing code for future you and across projects

	npm install -g private-package-manager

commands
	
	pm --help,h - to show help
	
	pm upload [filepath] to send the file to the storage directory
